Guidance for Centipede UI Test
-------------------------------
This project is an interpretation of the classic game 'Centipede!'...but the UI is terrible!

Your objective is to wrap the basic game in a well-presented, slick and polished UI. How could the game be presented in modern, dynamic and professional way (in the short time you have available!)?

Feel free to make any changes you wish to the project in order to facilitate your end goals!

Consider:
- Title screen
- In-game HUD
- Results
- Transitions between screens
- Optimisation
- User interaction and experience
- Gloss and shininess
- Performance (where/if necessary)
- How Unity UI can be best used to accomplish your goals

Please also write a summary of any further work that you would have liked to have done if you had more time.  In particular consider technical polish and how it would be applied, e.g. optimisation techniques and include your reasoning for wanting to do the work.

When returning your test...you can safely delete the Library, Logs and Temp folders to make your .zip file smaller! 

Please email your project and written summary back to david.king@pixeltoys.com at the end of the test.
