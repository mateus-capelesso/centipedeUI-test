<b>CentipedeUI</b>

This is a small test for another studio that I made this year. 

They sent me a centipede game project, and I had to create the UI. 
Here are the guidelines for the test


Guidance for Centipede UI Test
-------------------------------
This project interprets the classic game 'Centipede!'...but the UI is terrible!

Your objective is to wrap the basic game in a well-presented, slick, and polished UI. How could the game be presented in a modern, dynamic, and professional way (in the short time you have available!)?

Feel free to make any changes you wish to the project to facilitate your end goals!

Consider:
- Title screen
- In-game HUD
- Results
- Transitions between screens
- Optimisation
- User interaction and experience
- Gloss and shininess
- Performance (where/if necessary)
- How Unity UI can be best used to accomplish your goals
